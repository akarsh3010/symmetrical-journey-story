There was once a space explorer named Mark who had just returned from a 
mission to Mars. He was ecstatic on meeting his family after four years.

However, on Earth, not everything was the same after all that time.
World War 3 was fought, and now the United States was part of a new
conglomorate named "Republican Dominion of Afro-America"

Mark returned home to find his town devistated from the fighting. His home and 
family gone. Mark break down in tears, mourning his family. With nothing left at 
home he pack up his little remaining belongings and joins a mission to start a 
human continent on Jupiter.

After a few years of research Mark finally reached Jupiter only to realize that the Earth is on an infinite loop and world war 3 is happening all over again.
